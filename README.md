## Bash SkillCred Prep Material

This is a personal collection of excercises that I created to refresh my Bash scripting skills while preparing for the [Bash SkillCred Exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/bash/).

### How To Use This?
Each directory contains a Readme file with a problem statement and key Bash concepts used in the solution script. This can serve as a quick review or reference for the exam preparation.

### Index
1. [Introduction](./introduction/)
2. [Read User Input & Store It In a Variable](./variable_exports/)
3. TBD
